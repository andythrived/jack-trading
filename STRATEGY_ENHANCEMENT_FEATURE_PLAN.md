## Feature Dependencies and Sequencing

### **Current Dependencies (Problems)**
```
F001-US003 needs "strategies" â†’ But we only have price movements
F003-US001 needs "alpha sources" â†’ But we only have random data
F002-US001 generates "code" â†’ But for meaningless strategies
```

### **Enhanced Dependencies (Solutions)**
```
F002-US001 creates real strategies â†’ F001-US003 correlates them â†’ F003-US001 allocates capital
        â†“                                    â†“                           â†“
Technical indicators           Strategy correlation analysis    Portfolio with real alpha
        â†“                                    â†“                           â†“
Backtested performance        Diversification scoring          Risk-adjusted returns
```

**DEPENDENCY FLOW**:
1. **F002-US001** (Real strategies) provides validated alpha sources
2. **F001-US003** (Correlation) analyzes relationships between strategies  
3. **F003-US001** (Portfolio) constructs optimal allocation

## Timeline and Resource Impact

### **Original AlphaStrat Timeline**
- F002-US001: 4-6 weeks (code generation)
- F001-US003: 2-3 weeks (correlation UI)
- F003-US001: 3-4 weeks (portfolio allocation)
- **Total**: 9-13 weeks

### **Enhanced Timeline**
- F002-US001: 4-6 weeks (strategy engine + backtesting)
- F001-US003: 2-3 weeks (strategy correlation)
- F003-US001: 3-4 weeks (strategy portfolio)
- **Total**: 9-13 weeks (SAME)

### **Resource Impact**
- **Infrastructure**: No changes (same Docker, APIs, database)
- **Team Skills**: Python/FastAPI development (already required)
- **External Dependencies**: Financial libraries (TA-Lib, Vectorbt)
- **Data Requirements**: Same Polygon.io usage patterns

## Risk Assessment

### **Low Risk Changes**
- **Infrastructure Reuse**: Builds on proven Docker/FastAPI/PostgreSQL stack
- **Natural Progression**: Logical evolution from current scanner capabilities
- **Same Timeline**: No schedule impact vs original plan
- **Proven Approach**: Using established technical indicators and backtesting methods

### **Medium Risk Changes**
- **Strategy Performance**: Need to validate that implemented strategies actually work
- **Data Limitations**: Working within Polygon.io free tier constraints (3+ day old data)
- **Complexity Management**: Ensure backtesting doesn't become over-engineered

### **Mitigation Strategies**
- **Start Simple**: Begin with well-documented strategies (RSI mean reversion)
- **Incremental Development**: Build one indicator at a time
- **Performance Validation**: Use academic benchmarks for strategy validation
- **Scope Control**: Stick to proven indicators, avoid exotic strategies
