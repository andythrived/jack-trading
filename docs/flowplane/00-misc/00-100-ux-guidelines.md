# 00-100 - UX Guidelines

## Version: 1.0

## Inputs:

- User-provided design preferences

# **Aesthetics**

Bold simplicity with intuitive navigation creating frictionless experiences

- Breathable whitespace complemented by strategic color accents for visual hierarchy
- Strategic negative space calibrated for cognitive breathing room and content prioritization
- Systematic color theory applied through subtle gradients and purposeful accent placement
- Typography hierarchy utilizing weight variance and proportional scaling for information architecture
- Visual density optimization balancing information availability with cognitive load management
- Motion choreography implementing physics-based transitions for spatial continuity
- Accessibility-driven contrast ratios paired with intuitive navigation patterns ensuring universal usability
- Feedback responsiveness via state transitions communicating system status with minimal latency
- Content-first layouts prioritizing user objectives over decorative elements for task efficiency

# **Other UX concerns**

- **User goals and tasks** - Understanding what users need to accomplish and designing to make those primary tasks seamless and efficient
- **Information architecture** - Organizing content and features in a logical hierarchy that matches users' mental models
- **Progressive disclosure** - Revealing complexity gradually to avoid overwhelming users while still providing access to advanced features
- **Visual hierarchy** - Using size, color, contrast, and positioning to guide attention to the most important elements first
- **Affordances and signifiers** - Making interactive elements clearly identifiable through visual cues that indicate how they work
- **Consistency** - Maintaining uniform patterns, components, and interactions across screens to reduce cognitive load
- **Accessibility** - Ensuring the design works for users of all abilities (color contrast, screen readers, keyboard navigation)
- **Error prevention** - Designing to help users avoid mistakes before they happen rather than just handling errors after they occur
- **Feedback** - Providing clear signals when actions succeed or fail, and communicating system status at all times
- **Performance considerations** - Accounting for loading times and designing appropriate loading states
- **Mobile vs. desktop considerations** - Adapting layouts and interactions for different device capabilities and contexts
- **Responsive design** - Ensuring the interface works well across various screen sizes and orientations
- **User testing feedback loops** - Incorporating iterative testing to validate assumptions and improve the design
- **Platform conventions** - Following established patterns from iOS/Android/Web to meet user expectations
- **Microcopy and content strategy** - Crafting clear, concise text that guides users through the experience
- **Aesthetic appeal** - Creating a visually pleasing design that aligns with brand identity while prioritizing usability
- **Animations -** Crafting beautiful yet subtle animations and transitions that make the app feel professional
