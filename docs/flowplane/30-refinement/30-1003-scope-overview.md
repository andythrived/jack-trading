# Scope Overview: AI Trading Strategy Platform MVP

## Executive Summary

The AI Trading Strategy Platform MVP is a personal trading system that autonomously discovers, validates, and manages institutional-grade trading strategies. The system acts as an intelligent research team, continuously scanning US equities, available futures, and FX markets to identify exploitable inefficiencies, rigorously test them, and present only the most promising opportunities with clear explanations.

## Core Value Proposition

**Problem**: Manually identifying and validating trading opportunities across multiple markets is impossibly time-consuming and prone to human bias. Current platforms require existing strategy knowledge, but the real challenge is systematically discovering which market inefficiencies are exploitable.

**Solution**: An AI-powered system that handles the entire discovery-to-execution pipeline, from pattern recognition through code generation, with institutional-grade validation and clear explanations that don't assume trading expertise.

## Feature Overview

### F001: AI Strategy Discovery Engine (P0)
The core intelligence system that continuously analyzes market inefficiencies across multiple asset classes. Includes multi-market scanning, complexity optimization, diversification focus, correlation analysis, and pattern recognition capabilities.

### F002: Code Generation & Execution Bridge (P0)
Transforms validated strategies into executable code for multiple trading platforms with comprehensive safety checks. Handles platform-specific code generation, execution safeguards, and backtesting-to-live transitions.

### F003: Strategy Portfolio Management (P0)
Manages the complete strategy lifecycle with correlation-based portfolio construction, automated strategy rotation, and comprehensive risk management dashboards.

### F004: Intelligent Validation Framework (P0)
Ensures only robust strategies reach production through asset-specific validation rules, complexity-adjusted testing, and continuous performance verification.

### F005: Strategy Insight & Research Integration (P1)
Provides clear explanations and market context without assuming expertise. Includes strategy explanation engine, market research aggregation, and performance context provision.

### F006: Web-Based Command Center (P0)
Clean, intuitive interface for strategy discovery review and portfolio management with real-time monitoring capabilities.

## Technology Foundation

**Architecture**: Next.js frontend with FastAPI backend, PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB for time-series data
**Market Data**: Polygon.io for comprehensive market coverage
**Execution**: Alpaca for commission-free trading with built-in paper trading
**Key Libraries**: Vectorbt for backtesting, PyPortfolioOpt for optimization, OpenAI for explanations

## Market Coverage (MVP)

**Included**: US equities, major FX pairs via Alpaca, CME micro futures (limited selection)
**Post-MVP**: Full futures coverage, international markets, options strategies

## Success Metrics

- **Discovery**: 20+ validated strategies monthly across asset classes
- **Diversification**: 5+ uncorrelated strategies (correlation <0.3) running simultaneously
- **Execution**: Generated code runs without modification, <1% execution error rate
- **Efficiency**: <15 minutes daily to review opportunities, single-click deployment

## Development Approach

**Phase 1**: Core infrastructure and basic discovery (F001, F004, F006 foundation)
**Phase 2**: Code generation and portfolio management (F002, F003)
**Phase 3**: Research integration and advanced features (F005, advanced F006)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Financial Risk**: Multiple validation layers, paper trading transition, position limits
- **Technical Risk**: Proven technology stack, managed services, comprehensive testing
- **Market Risk**: Multi-asset diversification, correlation monitoring, regime detection

## Investment Required

**Development**: 3-4 months for MVP with single developer
**Infrastructure**: ~$100/month for production services (Railway, Polygon.io, Alpaca)
**Ongoing**: Minimal operational overhead with managed services approach

This MVP establishes the foundation for autonomous strategy discovery while maintaining clear boundaries for future expansion into institutional-grade features and additional markets.
