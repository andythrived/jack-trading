- **Alignment**: Aligned

#### AI/LLM Integration (OpenAI)
- **Scope**: Referenced in Strategy Explanation Engine
- **Architecture**: Defined for explanation generation and research summarization
- **Alignment**: Fully aligned

## Significant Gaps
None identified. All major features and components are present in both documents with appropriate technical implementations.

## Minor Differences (No Action Required)
- Futures terminology: Scope uses "CME micro futures" while Architecture uses "CME micro contracts" - same meaning
- Processing metrics: Scope mentions "1000+ hypotheses daily" while Architecture mentions "1000+ symbols per scan" - complementary metrics
- Backtest timing: Architecture specifies "5-120 minutes" while scope doesn't mention duration - not contradictory
- Component naming: Some architectural components use technical names while scope uses feature names - appropriate for each document type

## Alignment Assessment

### Coverage Metrics
- Features in Scope: 6 major features
- Features in Architecture: 6 major features with technical implementations
- Fully Aligned Features: 6
- Features with Minor Differences: 0
- Features with Significant Gaps: 0

### Technical Implementation Coverage
All scope requirements have corresponding technical solutions:
- Market scanning → Polygon.io + Celery workers
- Strategy validation → Vectorbt + custom validation framework
- Code generation → Jinja2 templates + platform-specific APIs
- Portfolio management → PyPortfolioOpt + Alpaca integration
- Research integration → OpenAI API + web scraping
- User interface → Next.js + real-time WebSocket updates

### Market Coverage Consistency
Both documents consistently define MVP boundaries:
- US equities via Alpaca ✓
- Major FX pairs via Alpaca ✓
- CME micro futures via Alpaca ✓
- Post-MVP expansion path clearly defined ✓

### Performance Requirements Alignment
Scope performance targets are architecturally supported:
- 50+ concurrent strategies → Railway infrastructure sized appropriately
- Sub-second UI responses → Redis caching + optimized queries
- 1000+ daily processing → Celery workers + Vectorbt performance
- Real-time updates → WebSocket integration with Alpaca

## Recommendation
**Documents are ready for implementation.** The alignment between scope and architecture is excellent, with all major features having clear technical implementations. Minor terminology differences are appropriate given the different audiences and purposes of each document. No updates are required to proceed with development.

The architecture comprehensively addresses all scope requirements with realistic technology choices, appropriate performance targets, and clear MVP boundaries that align with the stated market coverage limitations.
