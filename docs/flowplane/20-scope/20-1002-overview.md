# 1 - Scope: AI Trading Strategy Platform MVP (Personal Trading System)

## Overview

### Elevator Pitch
An AI-powered personal trading system that autonomously discovers and validates institutional-grade trading strategies by analyzing market inefficiencies, generating hypotheses, and rigorously testing opportunities before presenting only the most promising strategies for implementation.

### Problem Statement
As a sophisticated trader, manually identifying and validating trading opportunities across multiple markets is impossibly time-consuming and prone to human bias. Current platforms require traders to already have strategy ideas, but the real challenge is systematically discovering which market inefficiencies are exploitable, properly validating them with institutional-grade rigor, and managing a portfolio of strategies that maintains edge as markets evolve. Without AI-driven discovery and validation, traders miss profitable opportunities and waste time on strategies that look good in basic backtests but fail in live trading.

**MVP Market Coverage**: Initial release focuses on US equities and major FX pairs available through Alpaca, with futures market analysis limited to CME micro futures. Full futures coverage planned for post-MVP phase.

### Target Audience
**Primary User**: You (ambitious individual trader seeking institutional-grade results)
- Interested in systematic trading but not necessarily an expert
- Limited time to research markets and validate strategies
- Needs the platform to handle complex analysis and present clear insights
- Wants institutional-quality strategies without requiring institutional knowledge
- Requires automated risk management and clear explanations of what the system is doing

**Context of Problem**:
- Markets continuously evolve, making manual opportunity scanning ineffective
- Without deep expertise, it's hard to distinguish real patterns from noise
- Proper validation requires complex testing that most platforms don't automate
- Managing multiple strategies safely requires sophisticated risk controls built into the system

### Unique Selling Proposition (USP)
Unlike platforms that require you to already have trading expertise and strategy ideas, this system acts as your institutional-grade research teamâ€”autonomously discovering opportunities by analyzing market patterns that professional traders look for, thoroughly validating them through rigorous testing, and presenting only proven strategies with clear explanations of why they work and how to safely implement them.

### Target Platforms
Web-based application with Python backend - Provides clean UI for strategy review and management while leveraging powerful Python libraries for computation and strategy discovery.
