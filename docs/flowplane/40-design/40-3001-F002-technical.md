# Feature Technical Architecture - F002: Code Generation & Execution Bridge

## 1. Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Technical Strategy
F002 transforms validated trading strategies into executable code across multiple platforms while ensuring safety and reliability. The architecture leverages FastAPI for high-performance API services, PostgreSQL for strategy state management, and Redis for real-time execution monitoring. Alpaca's trading API serves as the primary execution platform with built-in paper trading capabilities, while the code generation system uses Jinja2 templating to produce platform-specific implementations.

### 1.2 Key Decisions

- **Decision**: Use Jinja2 templating engine for multi-platform code generation
- **Rationale**: Provides clean separation between strategy logic and platform-specific syntax, enabling maintainable templates for each target platform
- **Trade-offs**: Template maintenance overhead vs. type-safe code generation, but gains flexibility for multiple platform support

- **Decision**: Implement three-layer safety validation (pre-trade, broker-level, post-trade)
- **Rationale**: Financial systems require redundant safety mechanisms to prevent catastrophic losses from execution errors
- **Trade-offs**: Increased latency vs. comprehensive risk protection, prioritizing safety over speed

- **Decision**: Mandatory paper trading validation before live deployment
- **Rationale**: Ensures generated code performs as expected in realistic market conditions without financial risk
- **Trade-offs**: Delayed live deployment vs. validated performance, essential for user confidence

## 2. Shared Component Architecture

### 2.1 Multi-Platform Code Generator
- **Purpose**: Transforms strategy specifications into executable code for different trading platforms
- **Used By**: F002-US001, F002-US003
- **Behaviors**: 
  - Maintains platform-specific code templates using Jinja2
  - Validates generated code syntax using Abstract Syntax Tree parsing
  - Tracks code generation history and version control through Git integration
  - Enables platform-specific optimizations while preserving strategy logic
- **Constraints**: Generated code must be syntactically correct and include comprehensive error handling

### 2.2 Execution Safety System
- **Purpose**: Prevents dangerous trades through comprehensive validation and monitoring
- **Used By**: F002-US002, F002-US003
- **Behaviors**:
  - Validates position sizing against account balance and risk limits using Pydantic schemas
  - Monitors real-time trading activity through WebSocket connections
  - Coordinates with Alpaca's built-in risk controls for additional protection
  - Maintains configurable safety limits with hard-coded maximum boundaries
- **Constraints**: Sub-second validation latency for time-sensitive trading decisions

### 2.3 Strategy State Manager
- **Purpose**: Tracks strategy execution state and performance across deployment phases
- **Used By**: F002-US002, F002-US003
- **Behaviors**:
  - Maintains strategy lifecycle states in PostgreSQL (backtest → paper → small live → full live)
  - Coordinates automated progression through deployment phases
  - Tracks performance divergence between backtesting and live execution
  - Enables rollback capabilities when performance degrades beyond thresholds
- **Constraints**: State transitions must be atomic and auditable for compliance

## 3. Data Architecture

### 3.1 Strategy Code Repository
Strategy code and templates persist in PostgreSQL with version control integration. Each strategy maintains multiple code variants (Alpaca native, TradingView Pine Script, generic Python) with generation timestamps and validation status. Code templates reference strategy parameters through JSON schema definitions, enabling consistent generation across platforms.

### 3.2 Execution Monitoring Data
Real-time execution data flows through Redis for immediate access, with persistent storage in PostgreSQL using TimescaleDB for time-series optimization. Trade execution records include expected vs. actual fills, timing analysis, and performance attribution. Safety validation results maintain audit trails for regulatory compliance.

### 3.3 Performance Reconciliation
Strategy performance data maintains separate tracks for backtesting, paper trading, and live execution phases. PostgreSQL stores comparative metrics enabling automated detection of performance divergence. Correlation analysis between expected and actual performance triggers alerts when variance exceeds configured thresholds.

## 4. Service Layer

### 4.1 Code Generation Service
- **Technology**: FastAPI with Jinja2 templating engine
- **Responsibility**: Manages transformation of strategy logic into platform-specific executable code
- **Performance**: Generate syntactically correct code within 30 seconds for complex strategies

### 4.2 Safety Validation Service
- **Technology**: FastAPI with Pydantic validation schemas
- **Responsibility**: Coordinates multi-layer safety checks before trade execution
- **Performance**: Complete validation checks within 100 milliseconds for real-time trading

### 4.3 Execution Monitoring Service
- **Technology**: FastAPI with WebSocket connections to Alpaca
- **Responsibility**: Tracks live strategy performance and manages deployment progression
- **Performance**: Process execution updates with sub-second latency for immediate alerts

### 4.4 Paper Trading Coordinator
- **Technology**: Alpaca Paper Trading API integration
- **Responsibility**: Manages paper trading validation phase with identical execution logic
- **Performance**: Maintain paper trading environment with same latency as live trading

## 5. Integration Architecture

### 5.1 Strategy Execution Engine Integration
F002 coordinates with SVC-002 (Strategy Execution Engine) to receive validated strategy specifications and deploy generated code. The integration maintains strategy parameter consistency and execution context across the generation and deployment pipeline.

### 5.2 Market Data Pipeline Integration
Real-time market data from SVC-001 (Market Data Pipeline) feeds execution monitoring and safety validation systems. Integration ensures consistent data timing and synchronization for accurate performance measurement and risk assessment.

### 5.3 Validation Framework Integration
SVC-003 (Validation Framework) provides strategy validation results that trigger code generation workflows. Integration maintains validation status and ensures only approved strategies proceed to code generation and deployment phases.

### 5.4 External API Integration
- **Alpaca Trading API**: Primary execution platform providing both paper and live trading capabilities with identical API interfaces
- **Git Integration**: Version control for generated code and template management
- **WebSocket Connections**: Real-time monitoring of trade execution and account status
