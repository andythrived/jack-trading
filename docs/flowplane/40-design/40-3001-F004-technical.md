# Feature Technical Architecture - F004: Intelligent Validation Framework

## 1. Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Technical Strategy
The Intelligent Validation Framework leverages PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB for time-series validation data storage, Redis for caching validation results, and Celery for distributed validation processing. The framework integrates with Polygon.io for comprehensive market data validation and uses Pytest as the foundation for extensible validation rule execution. This architecture ensures rigorous testing of trading strategies before production deployment while maintaining the flexibility to adapt validation criteria based on strategy complexity and asset class characteristics.

### 1.2 Key Decisions
- **Decision**: Asset-specific validation rule engine with pluggable architecture
- **Rationale**: Different asset classes (equities, FX, futures) have unique market structures requiring specialized validation approaches
- **Trade-offs**: Increased complexity in rule management versus comprehensive coverage of market-specific risks

- **Decision**: Complexity-adjusted validation periods using statistical significance testing
- **Rationale**: More complex strategies with additional parameters require longer validation periods to ensure statistical robustness
- **Trade-offs**: Longer validation times for complex strategies versus reduced risk of overfitting

- **Decision**: Continuous performance monitoring with automated degradation detection
- **Rationale**: Live strategy performance must be continuously validated against backtesting expectations to catch regime changes
- **Trade-offs**: Additional computational overhead versus early detection of strategy degradation

## 3. Data Architecture

### 3.1 Validation Data Model
The validation framework maintains relationships between strategies, validation rules, test results, and performance metrics. Each strategy undergoes multiple validation phases with results stored in PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB for time-series performance tracking. Validation rules are organized hierarchically by asset class and complexity level, enabling efficient rule selection and execution.

### 3.2 Time-Series Performance Storage
Historical validation results and live performance metrics persist in TimescaleDB-optimized tables, enabling efficient querying of performance trends and statistical analysis. The data model supports correlation analysis between validation metrics and subsequent live performance.

### 3.3 Rule Configuration Management
Validation rules are stored as configurable parameters in PostgreSQL, allowing dynamic adjustment of validation criteria without code changes. Rule versioning enables tracking of validation standard evolution over time.

## 4. Service Layer

### 4.1 Validation Orchestration Service

### 4.2 Asset-Specific Rule Engine
- **Technology**: Pytest with custom plugins and Polygon.io market data integration
- **Responsibility**: Executes asset-class-specific validation rules with market data context
- **Performance**: Process validation rules within asset-specific time constraints (equity market hours, FX 24/7 validation)

### 4.3 Statistical Testing Service
- **Technology**: SciPy and custom statistical algorithms

## 5. Integration Architecture

### 5.1 Market Data Integration
The validation framework integrates with SVC-001 (Market Data Pipeline) to access comprehensive market data from Polygon.io for validation testing. This integration ensures validation uses the same data sources as strategy discovery and execution.

### 5.2 Strategy Execution Integration
Integration with SVC-002 (Strategy Execution Engine) enables seamless transition from validation to paper trading and live execution. The framework provides validation certificates that authorize strategy deployment.

### 5.3 Background Processing Integration
SVC-004 (Async Task Processor) handles computationally intensive validation tasks, enabling parallel processing of multiple strategy validations without blocking the user interface.

### 5.4 Real-Time Notification Integration
SVC-005 (Real-Time Notifications) delivers validation progress updates and completion notifications to users, maintaining transparency in the validation process.
