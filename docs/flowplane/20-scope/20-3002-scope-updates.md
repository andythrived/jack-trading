# Required Scope Updates

## Assessment Result
No changes are required to the scope document for implementation readiness.

## Analysis Summary
The alignment analysis found that the scope document comprehensively covers all necessary features and requirements, with appropriate technical implementations defined in the architecture document. All identified differences are minor terminology variations that do not impact understanding or implementation.

## Minor Differences Identified (No Action Required)
- Futures market terminology variations (both refer to same CME micro contracts)
- Processing metrics use complementary rather than contradictory language
- Architecture includes implementation timing details not present in scope (appropriate separation of concerns)

## Validation Confirmation
- ✅ All user stories have corresponding technical implementations
- ✅ All acceptance criteria are architecturally feasible
- ✅ Performance requirements align with technical capabilities
- ✅ Market coverage boundaries are consistently defined
- ✅ Non-functional requirements are comprehensively addressed

**Conclusion**: The scope document is implementation-ready as written. The natural differences between a user-focused scope document and a technical architecture document do not represent gaps requiring resolution.
