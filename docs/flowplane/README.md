## FlowPlane Methodology

This project uses FlowPlane to systematically generate documentation from initial ideas to implementation.

### Document Structure

- **01-discovery**: Initial exploration and ideation
- **02-architecture**: System architecture and design decisions
- **03-requirements**: Functional and technical requirements
- **04-ux-design**: User experience and interface design
- **05-technical**: Technical specifications and design details
- **06-implementation**: Implementation plans and code generation
- **07-deployment**: Deployment and operations documentation

## Getting Started

1. Run initial discovery: `flowplane runflow P00-10`
2. Check status: `flowplane status`
3. Continue with methodology steps as needed

## Generated Documents

_Documents will appear here as you run FlowPlane steps_
