# 1 - Scope: AI Trading Strategy Platform MVP (Personal Trading System)

## Overview

### Elevator Pitch
An AI-powered personal trading system that autonomously discovers and validates institutional-grade trading strategies by analyzing market inefficiencies, generating hypotheses, and rigorously testing opportunities before presenting only the most promising strategies for implementation.

### Problem Statement
As a sophisticated trader, manually identifying and validating trading opportunities across multiple markets is impossibly time-consuming and prone to human bias. Current platforms require traders to already have strategy ideas, but the real challenge is systematically discovering which market inefficiencies are exploitable, properly validating them with institutional-grade rigor, and managing a portfolio of strategies that maintains edge as markets evolve. Without AI-driven discovery and validation, traders miss profitable opportunities and waste time on strategies that look good in basic backtests but fail in live trading.

**MVP Market Coverage**: Initial release focuses on US equities and major FX pairs available through Alpaca, with futures market analysis limited to CME micro futures. Full futures coverage planned for post-MVP phase.

### Target Audience
**Primary User**: You (ambitious individual trader seeking institutional-grade results)
- Interested in systematic trading but not necessarily an expert
- Limited time to research markets and validate strategies
- Needs the platform to handle complex analysis and present clear insights
- Wants institutional-quality strategies without requiring institutional knowledge
- Requires automated risk management and clear explanations of what the system is doing

**Context of Problem**:
- Markets continuously evolve, making manual opportunity scanning ineffective
- Without deep expertise, it's hard to distinguish real patterns from noise
- Proper validation requires complex testing that most platforms don't automate
- Managing multiple strategies safely requires sophisticated risk controls built into the system

### Unique Selling Proposition (USP)
Unlike platforms that require you to already have trading expertise and strategy ideas, this system acts as your institutional-grade research team—autonomously discovering opportunities by analyzing market patterns that professional traders look for, thoroughly validating them through rigorous testing, and presenting only proven strategies with clear explanations of why they work and how to safely implement them.

### Target Platforms
Web-based application with Python backend - Provides clean UI for strategy review and management while leveraging powerful Python libraries for computation and strategy discovery.

## Features

### AI Strategy Discovery Engine
The core intelligence that continuously hunts for exploitable market inefficiencies across US equities, futures, and FX markets.

#### Multi-Market Inefficiency Scanner
- **User Story**: As a trader seeking diversification, I want the system to scan across equities, futures, and FX simultaneously, so that I discover uncorrelated opportunities across asset classes
- **Problem Addressed**: Single-market focus leads to correlated strategies that fail together during regime changes
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Scans US equity microstructure for order book imbalances and flow patterns (via Alpaca market data)
  - [ ] Monitors futures term structure for calendar spread opportunities (limited to CME micro futures via Alpaca in MVP)
  - [ ] Detects FX triangular arbitrage and carry trade dislocations (major pairs only via Alpaca)
  - [ ] Identifies cross-asset relationships (e.g., USD strength vs equity sectors, commodity ETFs as proxy)
  - [ ] Tracks index rebalancing effects across equity and available futures markets

#### Strategy Complexity Optimizer
- **User Story**: As a trader unsure about optimal complexity, I want the system to automatically determine the right strategy sophistication level, so that I achieve the best risk-adjusted returns
- **Problem Addressed**: Too simple strategies miss edge, too complex strategies overfit and break down in live trading
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Tests multiple complexity levels for each opportunity (simple → complex)
  - [ ] Compares single-instrument vs pairs vs portfolio approaches
  - [ ] Evaluates whether added complexity improves risk-adjusted returns
  - [ ] Considers execution feasibility for each complexity level
  - [ ] Recommends minimal complexity that captures the inefficiency

#### Diversification-Focused Discovery
- **User Story**: As a portfolio builder, I want the system to prioritize finding uncorrelated strategies, so that my portfolio remains robust across market conditions
- **Problem Addressed**: Most strategies are variations of the same underlying factors, leading to hidden correlation risk
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Maintains "diversity score" for each new strategy candidate
  - [ ] Prioritizes opportunities with low correlation to existing strategies
  - [ ] Identifies different strategy types: momentum, mean reversion, arbitrage, flow-based
  - [ ] Ensures coverage across different holding periods (intraday to multi-week)
  - [ ] Targets different market conditions (trending, ranging, volatile, calm)

### Code Generation & Execution Bridge
Transforms validated strategies into executable code for various trading platforms.

#### Multi-Platform Code Generator
- **User Story**: As a trader using multiple execution venues, I want strategies automatically converted to platform-specific code, so that I can deploy without manual translation errors

  - [ ] Creates Pine Script for TradingView alerts/automation
  - [ ] Produces generic Python for custom integrations
  - [ ] Exports to MetaTrader 5 Expert Advisors for FX (post-MVP feature)
  - [ ] Produces QuantConnect/Lean algorithm code (post-MVP feature)
  - [ ] Includes all validated parameters and risk limits

#### Execution Safeguard System
- **User Story**: As a risk-conscious trader, I want generated code to include safety checks, so that execution errors don't cause catastrophic losses

- **Problem Addressed**: Many profitable backtests fail in live trading due to implementation differences
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Generates identical logic for backtest and live systems
  - [ ] Includes gradual position scaling for new strategies
  - [ ] Creates paper trading version for validation
  - [ ] Logs all decisions for live vs backtest comparison

### Intelligent Validation Framework
Ensures only robust strategies make it to production, with particular focus on cross-asset complexity.

#### Asset-Specific Validation Rules
- **User Story**: As a multi-asset trader, I want validation that accounts for each market's unique characteristics, so strategies aren't rejected due to inappropriate tests

  - [ ] FX: 24-hour market dynamics, weekend gaps considered
  - [ ] Cross-asset: time zone synchronization validated with proper UTC handling
  - [ ] Appropriate transaction cost models per asset class

#### Complexity-Adjusted Testing
- **User Story**: As a trader, I want more rigorous testing for complex strategies, so that I'm not fooled by overfit multi-parameter systems
- **Problem Addressed**: Complex strategies can easily overfit, requiring exponentially more validation
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Single-instrument strategies: standard validation pipeline
  - [ ] Pairs/spreads: additional cointegration and stability tests
  - [ ] Multi-instrument: higher out-of-sample requirements
  - [ ] Increases Monte Carlo runs with parameter count
  - [ ] Requires longer profitable history for complex strategies

### Strategy Insight & Research Integration

- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Automatically researches strategies against institutional research (accessible sources)
  - [ ] Aggregates insights from reputable financial sites (WSJ, Bloomberg, Reuters)
  - [ ] Identifies when professional traders use similar approaches
  - [ ] Flags strategies that go against conventional wisdom with explanations
  - [ ] Links to educational resources for deeper understanding when desired

#### Performance Context Provider
- **User Story**: As a trader, I want to understand how my strategies perform compared to simple benchmarks, so I know if the complexity is worthwhile
