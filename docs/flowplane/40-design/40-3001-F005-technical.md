# Feature Technical Architecture - F005: Strategy Insight & Research Integration

## 1. Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Technical Strategy
F005 leverages OpenAI API for natural language generation, PostgreSQL for content storage, and Celery for background research aggregation. The feature transforms complex trading strategies into accessible explanations while providing market context through automated research gathering. This approach enables non-expert users to understand sophisticated strategies without requiring deep trading knowledge.

### 1.2 Key Decisions

- **Decision**: OpenAI API for explanation generation
- **Rationale**: Provides sophisticated natural language capabilities with consistent output quality for financial content
- **Trade-offs**: External dependency and API costs vs building custom NLP models

- **Decision**: Web scraping for research aggregation over paid research APIs
- **Rationale**: Cost-effective access to public financial content during MVP phase
- **Trade-offs**: Maintenance overhead for scraping vs guaranteed API stability

- **Decision**: PostgreSQL storage for explanations and research content
- **Rationale**: Leverages existing database infrastructure with full-text search capabilities
- **Trade-offs**: Single database vs specialized document storage for better search performance

- **Used By**: F005-US002
- **Behaviors**:
  - Maintains web scraping schedules for financial news sources
  - Coordinates content filtering and relevance scoring
  - Tracks source credibility and content freshness
  - Enables RSS feed aggregation for real-time updates
- **Constraints**: Respect robots.txt, daily update frequency, credible sources only

### 2.3 Performance Context Provider
- **Purpose**: Generates market context and benchmark comparisons for strategy performance
- **Used By**: F005-US003
- **Behaviors**:
  - Maintains benchmark calculation algorithms using Vectorbt
  - Coordinates performance comparison across market regimes
  - Tracks strategy behavior during different market conditions
  - Enables contextual metric explanations for non-experts
- **Constraints**: Multiple benchmark comparisons, simplified metric presentation

### 2.4 Content Management System
- **Purpose**: Stores and retrieves explanations, research, and performance context
- **Used By**: All F005 stories
- **Behaviors**:
  - Maintains PostgreSQL storage for structured content
  - Coordinates full-text search across explanations and research
  - Tracks content versioning and update history
  - Enables content categorization and tagging
- **Constraints**: Full-text search performance, content freshness tracking

## 3. Data Architecture

### 3.1 Content Relationships
- Strategy explanations link to specific strategy configurations with one-to-one cardinality
- Research articles associate with multiple strategies through many-to-many relationships
- Performance context connects to strategy performance history with temporal relationships
- Content categories organize explanations and research through hierarchical structures

### 3.2 Data Flow Patterns
Market research flows from external sources through scraping pipelines into PostgreSQL storage. Strategy specifications trigger explanation generation through OpenAI API with results cached in database. Performance data combines with market context to generate comparative analysis stored alongside strategy records.

### 3.3 Persistence Requirements
PostgreSQL stores explanation content with full-text indexing for search capabilities. Research articles persist with source attribution and credibility scores. Performance context maintains historical comparisons across different market periods. All content includes versioning for tracking changes over time.
