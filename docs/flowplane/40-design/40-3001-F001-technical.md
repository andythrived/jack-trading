# Feature Technical Architecture - F001: AI Strategy Discovery Engine

## 1. Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Technical Strategy
The AI Strategy Discovery Engine leverages PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB extension for efficient time-series data storage and retrieval, enabling rapid analysis of multi-asset market inefficiencies. Redis provides high-performance caching for real-time market data streams from Polygon.io, while Celery orchestrates distributed processing across multiple worker nodes. This architecture enables the system to process 1000+ symbols simultaneously while maintaining sub-minute latency for intraday opportunity detection.

### 1.2 Key Decisions
- **Decision**: Use Vectorbt for backtesting and hypothesis testing
- **Rationale**: Vectorized operations provide 100x performance improvement over loop-based alternatives, enabling rapid testing of multiple strategy variations
- **Trade-offs**: Gain massive performance improvements but sacrifice some flexibility in custom indicator development

- **Decision**: Implement Polygon.io WebSocket for real-time data ingestion
- **Rationale**: Sub-minute latency requirements demand streaming data rather than polling APIs
- **Trade-offs**: Achieve real-time processing but increase system complexity and connection management overhead

- **Decision**: Separate discovery workers by asset class specialization
- **Rationale**: Different asset classes require specialized analysis patterns and market structure knowledge
- **Trade-offs**: Enable optimized processing per asset type but increase worker management complexity

## 3. Data Architecture

### 3.1 Time-Series Data Model
Market data persists in PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB extension, optimized for time-series queries across multiple asset classes. The system maintains 5 years of historical minute-bar data with automatic partitioning by time and symbol. Real-time data flows through Redis buffers before PostgreSQL persistence, enabling both immediate analysis and historical backtesting.

### 3.2 Strategy Discovery State
Discovery processes maintain state through PostgreSQL tables tracking pattern analysis progress, validation results, and optimization history. Each discovered strategy includes metadata about market conditions, statistical significance, and complexity scores. The system preserves complete audit trails for regulatory compliance and performance analysis.

### 3.3 Correlation Matrices
Cross-asset correlation data stores in specialized PostgreSQL tables with TimescaleDB compression for efficient historical analysis. Rolling correlation calculations update incrementally, maintaining multiple timeframe perspectives (daily, weekly, monthly) for regime change detection.

All timestamps convert to UTC using pytz for consistent analysis across global markets. Corporate actions data from Polygon.io reference API ensures strategy validation accounts for stock splits and dividends.

### 5.2 Infrastructure Services
Discovery processes utilize shared infrastructure services including the async task processor for distributed computation and the validation framework for strategy verification. Real-time notifications service provides updates on discovery progress and newly identified opportunities.

### 5.3 Event Patterns
The system publishes discovery events through Redis pub/sub channels, enabling real-time updates to the web interface and triggering downstream validation processes. Event payloads include strategy metadata, performance metrics, and correlation analysis results.
